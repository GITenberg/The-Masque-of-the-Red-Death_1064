description: Everything is in ruins.A devastating plague has decimated the population,
  and those who are left live in fear of catching it as the city crumbles around them.So
  what does Araby Worth have to live for?Nights in the Debauchery Club, beautiful
  dresses, glittery makeup . . . and tantalizing ways to forget it all.But in the
  depths of the club—in the depths of her own despair—Araby will find more than oblivion.
  She will find Will, the terribly handsome proprietor of the club, and Elliott, the
  wickedly smart aristocrat. Neither is what he seems. Both have secrets. Everyone
  does.And Araby may find not just something to live for, but something to fight for—no
  matter what it costs her.
